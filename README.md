## How to Play

### Objective
- Your goal is to combine tiles on a 4x4 grid to create a tile with the number **2048**.
- The game ends when the grid is full and no more moves are possible.

### Controls
- **Desktop**: Use the arrow keys to slide tiles:
  - **↑** (Up)
  - **↓** (Down)
  - **←** (Left)
  - **→** (Right)
- **Mobile**: Swipe on the screen in the direction you want the tiles to move (up, down, left, or right).

### Rules
- Each move slides all tiles on the grid in the chosen direction until they hit the edge or another tile.
- When two tiles with the **same number** collide, they merge into one tile with **double the value** (e.g., 2 + 2 = 4).
- After every move, a new tile (either **2** or **4**) appears in a random empty spot.
- The game is over when the grid is full and no merges or moves are possible.
